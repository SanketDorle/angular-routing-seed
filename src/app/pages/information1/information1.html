<h1>RouterLink binding</h1>
<h3>within the anchor tags, you see attribute bindings to the RouterLink directive that look like routerLink="...".</h3>
<h3>The links in this example each have a string path, the path of a route that you configured earlier. There are no route parameters yet.</h3>
<h3>You can also add more contextual information to the RouterLink by providing query string parameters or a URL fragment for jumping to different areas on the page.</h3>
